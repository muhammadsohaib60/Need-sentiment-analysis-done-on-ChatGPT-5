# Need-sentiment-analysis-done-on-ChatGPT-5

I require a sentiment analysis focused on perceptions of the latest version of ChatGPT. The analysis should be accompanied by several visualizations. Additionally, please provide an overview of the software you're using, specifically SentimentR, detailing its capabilities. Finally, include a discussion of the benefits and limitations (with particular attention to weaknesses) of sentiment analysis in comparison to other analytical methods.
